# Discriminatory

Discriminatory is a social network with 1 goal in mind — to end discrimination. Our goals are simple: expose, discuss, change. Expose crooked businesses that employ prejudice-based policies, discuss how we can fix that with them, change their policies and make the world a better place — just a bit. Of course this is not always possible. Some people will fight back acting as if they're in the right. They'll claim "my place my rules", but we all know too well the law doesn't work that way.
