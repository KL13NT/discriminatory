# Discriminatory

Discriminatory is a social network with 1 goal in mind â€” to end discrimination. Our goals are simple: expose, discuss, change. Expose crooked business that employ prejudice-based policies, discuss how we can fix that with them, change their reality. Of course this is not always possible. People will probably fight back, act as if they're in the right. They'll say their place their rules, but we all know the law doesn't work that way.
