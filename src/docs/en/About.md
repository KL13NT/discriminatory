# Background

I'm a Muslim Egyptian Frontend Software Engineer and Computer Science student born and raised in Egypt. Back in 2015 me and my family (parents and brother) were going on a summer vacation in a somewhat well-known hotel in one of the major cities in Egypt.

My mother, as you've probably guessed, is a muhajjabaha (wears Hijab) and at the time apparently the hotel had a non-hijab policy for its pools, beaches, and pretty much everywhere. This was not documented in any way possible.

We were going to the beach one day when a worker came to us saying that "my mother isn't allowed to use the pool or the beaches because of her hijab. My mother doesn't even know how to swim so there's 0 chance that she'd actually swim. She spend her time on beaches just enjoying the sand and the beautiful summer beach weather all around. We explained that, but the worker insisted that she leaves.

Imagine. Just imagine being a 15 year old seeing someone kicking your mother out of a spot you *paid* for (we had premium at the time too) just because of what she's wearing. Or even better, imagine being *her*.

I didn't understand this at the time, but as time went by I started recieving and finding more and more news about muhajjabat (women who wear hijab) getting kicked out of places without a right, just because of their clothing preference and culture. This also expanded these days apparently to businesses preventing muhajjabat from working normal jobs, entering certain shops, or even just being in a certain neighbourhood. I have friends that are discriminated against just because of their skin colour, friends who are struggling to keep a happy life, and a lot more that are dealing with mental and psychological damage because of discrimination. It's time for a change.

# Why I built Discriminatory

If it isn't obvious already, I built Discriminatory as a way to expose discriminators. Businesses that suppress black people their rights, prejudistic judgements, bullies at workplaces, toxic environments built on discriminatory behaviour, and human rights violations wherever, whenever, however. This is *not* a complete list by all means. There's a lot of potential for such a service, and I just wish that it does its job well and manages to succeed in its goal.

# How

The mechanism is simple and can be summed up in 3 easy steps:

1. Make a post about a business, person, or any entity that discriminates against you directly or indirectly, or against someone else you witnessed.

2. Get community support and confirmation. We can't believe everyone, there are liars, fakers, spammers, and trolls. That's why you can either 'upvote' or 'downvote' a post. The more upvotes there is, the higher the possibility that it's not a lie. You can also comment more details or prove a post is fake.

3. This is a result. Either the discriminatory entities back off and apologize, promising to change their policies, or they keep their name in the dirt.

There's also an extra step. That is search. Discriminatory has a location keyword-based search that you can use. The most useful use case I could see for it is the following:

1. You may want to work with someone, in a community, a business, or spend a vacation somewhere.

2. Search for the name of that entity.

3. If it's found you'll be able to decide based on the ratio of upvotes, downvotes, and comments whether that entity is discriminatory or not. If it is simply don't communicate with them, if they're not then happily continue what you had planned.

# Wrapping up

I hope to see activists, human rights organisations, and the people come together and support this platform. Such activists and organisations can boost the platform by working with people who use it to come to terms with discriminator entities. I see a lot of potential.

Thank you,
